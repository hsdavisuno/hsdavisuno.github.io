<!---INTRODUCTION--->

      <section>

	<a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/heather-s-davis" target="_blank"><img class="myimage" src="Headshot.png"/></a>
	<br>
	<p>I am a full-time Sr. Learning Systems Analyst for <a href ="https://www.conagrabrands.com" target="_blank">Conagra Brands</a> in Omaha (currently working from home) and a part-time MS MIS student with a concentration in data analytics. In my job, I manage the Workday Learning system for my employer. I have a Masters of Education in Educational Technology from <a href = "https://www.asu.edu" target="_blank">Arizona State University</a> and have worked in learning technologies for over 20 years.
	</p>

	<p>
	With my second masters, I am looking to move into an even more technical role. This is my fourth semester at UNO. After this semester, I will be about half way through my degree. Fun fact: I learned to hand-code HTML for the first time in 1995 using TextEdit and Netscape Navigator. We were required to keep all our graphics under 12K.
